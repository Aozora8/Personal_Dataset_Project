# Personal_Dataset_Project
[Motivation]
My motivation for this project came from when I was browsing Netflix and I noticed several anime titles that seemed less of a name and more like a sentence. This is where I got the question “are anime titles getting longer?”.

[Data Process]
The original data is from the wikipedia page on anime titles from 2000 to 2021. The first step was to copy the data from the website and paste it into excel. Next was the cleaning process. The first thing I did was clean up the dates so they matched. Because the original data was in Japanese the dates were not properly read in excel. I used the find/replace feature to replace and remove Japanese characters and made the column uniform. A lot of the more recent anime titles were missing end dates so I removed that part of the data entirely. In addition some titles were missing release dates too so I decided to remove them completely. The second step was to reformat the number of episodes. This process was pretty much identical to reformatting the dates. The third step was removing unrelated parts from the title. This refers to the extra information included in the parentheses. Once all of that was done I added two columns, one for character count with spaces and one without spaces. Finally, because I was only interested in anime series I removed all anime titles that had less than 10 episodes.

[Visualization]
I looked at four aspects in my dataset. These figures are available in
 [Figure 1]  Shows how anime title lengths changed between 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 2]  Shows how many anime titles were made in 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 3]  Shows the total number of anime episodes were made per year. 
 [Figure 4]  Shows the average number of episodes per show by year.
