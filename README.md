# Personal_Dataset_Project
[Motivation]
My motivation for this project came from when I was browsing Netflix and I noticed several anime titles that seemed less of a name and more like a sentence. This is where I got the question “are anime titles getting longer?”.

[Data Process]
The original data is from the wikipedia page on anime titles from 2000 to 2021. The first step was to copy the data from the website and paste it into excel. Next was the cleaning process. The first thing I did was clean up the dates so they matched. Because the original data was in Japanese the dates were not properly read in excel. I used the find/replace feature to replace and remove Japanese characters and made the column uniform. A lot of the more recent anime titles were missing end dates so I removed that part of the data entirely. In addition some titles were missing release dates too so I decided to remove them completely. The second step was to reformat the number of episodes. This process was pretty much identical to reformatting the dates. The third step was removing unrelated parts from the title. This refers to the extra information included in the parentheses. Once all of that was done I added two columns, one for character count with spaces and one without spaces. Finally, because I was only interested in anime series I removed all anime titles that had less than 10 episodes.

[Visualization]
I looked at four aspects in my dataset. These figures are available in "Personal_Dataset_HW11_Report.pdf".
 [Figure 1]  Shows how anime title lengths changed between 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 2]  Shows how many anime titles were made in 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 3]  Shows the total number of anime episodes were made per year. 
 [Figure 4]  Shows the average number of episodes per show by year. 

[Analysis]
While my original question was if anime title names were getting longer, I noticed other interesting patterns in the dataset while trying different visuals.

[Figure 1] shows that there is a gradual increase in the average character count in anime title names. The actual increase is only 3 characters over 20 years.

[Figure 2] is the number of anime titles. Shows as a whole the number is increasing, however there is a small dip around 2010 and 2021.

[Figure 3] is about the total number of episode made per year. It shows that the total number of anime episodes made per year is increasing. However, like [Figure 2] there are small dips near 2010 and 2021.

[Figure 4] shows the average number of episodes per anime title by year. This was one of the most interesting plots in that it shows almost a straight decline in numbers of episodes per title. This means that the length of each anime series is getting shorter by the year.

Knowing all of this there are areas I am still curious about. Firstly, I want to figure out why there is a dip in number of titles toward the years 2010 and 2021. Secondly, it would be interesting to find out why anime titles are getting longer, whether it is something to do with style or sales or something I am not thinking of. And Finally, using multiple methods and measurements to find what makes a good anime.
