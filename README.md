# Personal_Dataset_Project
[Motivation]
My motivation for this project came from when I was browsing Netflix and I noticed several anime titles that seemed less of a name and more like a sentence. This is where I got the question “are anime titles getting longer?”.

[Data Process]


I looked at four aspects in my dataset.
 [Figure 1]  Shows how anime title lengths changed between 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 2]  Shows how many anime titles were made in 2000 to 2021. 
 [Figure 3]  Shows the total number of anime episodes were made per year. 
 [Figure 4]  Shows the average number of episodes per show by year.
